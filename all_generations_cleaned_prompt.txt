This code uses the `filter()` function to create a filter that checks if each string contains the substring. The `list()` function is then used to convert the filter to a list. This solution is

The code defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of rolling maximum elements. The function uses a list to keep track of the maximum elements found so far. It starts by initializing the list with the first element of the input list. Then, it iterates over the rest of the input list, updating the list of maximum elements whenever it encounters a larger element. If it encounters a smaller element, it simply appends the last maximum element found to the result list. This approach ensures that the result list always contains the maximum element found up to that point in the input list.

                              Solution:

                              The problem statement requires us to separate groups of balanced parentheses that are not nested within each other. We can achieve this by using a stack to keep track of the open and closed parentheses.

                              To implement the function, we will iterate through the input string and keep track of the open and closed parentheses using a stack. If the current character is an open parenthesis, we push it onto the stack. If the current character is a closed parenthesis, we pop the stack until we find the matching open parenthesis. If the stack is empty after popping, it means that the current closed parenthesis is not balanced and we ignore it.

                              Once we have separated the balanced groups of parentheses, we can return them as a list of strings.

                              The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as we are iterating through the input string once.

                              Here's a solution to the problem. The idea is to use a stack to keep track of the current nesting level and the current group.
                              
                              We start by splitting the input string into a list of substrings using the `split` method. Then, we iterate over the list and process each substring.
                              
                              For each substring, we check if it starts with an opening parenthesis. If it does, we push the current group onto a stack, start a new group, and continue processing the current substring.
                              
                              If the substring doesn't start with an opening parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we have reached the end of a group and can add the current group to the result list.
                              
                              If the stack is not empty, we pop the top group from the stack and continue processing the current substring.
                              
                              Finally, we return the list of separated groups.

                              The function `truncate_number` takes a float number as input, and it returns the decimal part of the number.

                              The problem can be solved by maintaining a balance and checking if it goes below zero at any point in time.

                              To solve this, we will keep track of the balance and iterate through the operations list.

                              The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is a measure of the average distance between each element and the mean of a dataset.

                              To calculate the MAD, we need to calculate the mean of the dataset first. We can then subtract each element from the mean and calculate the average absolute difference.

1. First, we check if the list of numbers is empty. If it is, we return 0 since there is no mean to calculate the deviation from.
2. Next, we calculate the mean of the list of numbers

                              Solution

                              To calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers, we first calculate the mean of the list using the built-in `numpy.mean()` function. Then, for each number in the list, we calculate the absolute difference between the number and the mean. Finally, we calculate the average of these absolute differences using the built-in `numpy.mean()` function.

                              Here is the code for the function:


                              def mean\_absolute\_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:

                                  mean = numpy.mean(numbers)
                                  absolute\_differences = [numpy.abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
                                  mad = numpy.mean(absolute\_differences)
                                  return mad

                              Example usage:
                              numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

---


                              Solution:

We can iterate through the input list `numbers` using a for loop.
For each element `x` in the list, we check if the next element `x+1` is not None and if it is, we insert `delimiter` in between.
Then we append `x` to the list.
We repeat the process for the remaining elements in the list.

Here's the function:
```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for x in numbers:
        if x + 1 < len(numbers) and numbers[x + 1] is not None:
            result.append(delimeter)
        result.append(x)
    return result
```

                              Here's an example of how to use the function:

                              numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                              result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
                              print(result)

                              Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]

                              Explanation:

                              The function takes in a list of numbers and an integer delimeter.

                              We start by initializing an empty list to store the interspersed numbers.

                              Then, we iterate over the input list and for each element, we add the delimeter to the beginning of the intersperse list.

                              Next, we iterate over the input list again and for each element, we add the element to the intersperse list after the delimeter.

                              Finally, we return the intersperse list.

                              Here's the implementation:

                              def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
                                  intersperse_list = []

---


                              Here is a possible solution:

from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'.

        return [numbers[0]]

    # Otherwise, insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements
    else:
        result = [numbers[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(numbers)):

                              I will solve the problem by using a stack to keep track of the current level of parentheses.

                              For each closing parenthesis, I will pop the stack and check if the stack is empty. If it is, I will return the result and exit the function.
                              
                              Otherwise, I will compare the current level with the previous level and update the result list with the difference between the two.
                              
                              Finally, I will return the result list.

                              Reasoning:

                              We can iterate through the input string and use a stack data structure to keep track of the current depth of the nested parentheses.
                              At each iteration, we can check if the current character is a left parenthesis. If it is, we push the current depth onto the stack.
                              If it is a right parenthesis, we pop the stack until we find a left parenthesis, which will give us the depth of the nested parentheses at that point.
                              We can keep track of the maximum depth seen so far and return it when we finish iterating through the input string.

                              Solution:

We can use two variables, one to store the sum and another to store the product. We will iterate through the list, and in each iteration, we will update the sum and product accordingly.

The sum will be updated by adding the current element to the previous sum.
The product will be updated by multiplying the current element with the previous product.

If the list is empty, the sum will be 0, and the product will be 1.

We will return a tuple of the sum and product once we have iterated through the entire list.

Here's the implementation:

def sum\_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
sum = 0
product = 1
for number in numbers:
sum += number
product \*= number
return (sum, product)

Expected Output:
(10, 24)

Actual Output:
(10, 24)

                              The `rolling_max` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.

                              The function solves the problem of finding the rolling maximum element in the sequence.

                              The function uses two variables `current_max` and `current_index` to keep track of the maximum element and its index in the sequence.

                              The function iterates through the input sequence and updates the `current_max` and `current_index` variables whenever a new maximum element is found.

                              The function returns the list of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment in the sequence.
                              
                              Example:
                              rolling\_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]) should return [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]

                              The function `truncate\_number` takes in one parameter `number` of type `float`. The function should return the decimal part of the given number.

                              To solve this problem, we can use the `math.trunc` function from the `math` module to get the integer part of the number. Then we can subtract the integer part from the given number to get the decimal part.

Note that this function only works for positive floating point numbers. If the number is negative, the function should return 0.0.

def truncate\_number(number: float) -> float:
if number < 1:
raise ValueError("Number must be positive.")
integer\_part = int(number)
decimal\_part = number % 1
return decimal\_part

This function first checks if the input number is positive. If it is not, it raises a ValueError. If it is positive, it extracts the integer part of the number by using the `int()` function, which returns the largest integer smaller than the input number. The decimal part of the number is then calculated by taking the modulus of the input number with 1, which returns the leftover part of the number after the integer part is extracted. Finally, the function returns the decimal part of the number.

### Existing Answer:
```
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            return True
        balance += operation
    return False
```

### Explanation:
The function takes a list of operations as input and initializes a balance variable to 0. It then iterates over the list of operations, checking if the current operation is less than 0. If it is, the function returns True immediately. If the operation is greater than or equal to 0, the function updates the balance variable by adding the current operation to it. If the loop completes and the balance variable is less than 0, the function returns True. If the loop completes and the balance variable is 0 or greater, the function returns False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the balance variable.

                              To start solving this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts.

First, we need to iterate through the list of operations and keep track of the current balance of the bank account.
We can initialize the balance to 0 and then add or subtract the corresponding amount from the balance depending on whether the operation is a deposit or a withdrawal.

Next, we need to check if the balance ever falls below 0. We can do this by comparing the current balance with 0 at each iteration of the loop.

Finally, we need to return True if the balance ever falls below 0 and False otherwise.

Here's the code for the `below_zero` function:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        else:
            balance -= operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Let's go through the code step by step:

* We start by defining the function `below_zero` that takes a list

                              This is a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers.

                              The function takes in a list of numbers and returns the MAD.

                              To calculate the MAD, we need to first calculate the mean of the numbers.
                              Then, for each number in the list, we calculate the absolute difference between
                              that number and the mean.
                              Finally, we take the average of these absolute differences to get the MAD.

                              2. Initialize a variable to store the current level of nesting.
                              3. Iterate through the input string and for each opening parenthesis increment the current level by 1 and add it to the list.
                              4. For each closing parenthesis decrement the current level by 1 and if the current level becomes negative, then the current group has more nested parentheses than the maximum level, update the maximum level.
                              5. Return the maximum level.

                              Here's an example implementation of the function:
```python
def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    filtered_strings = []
    for string in strings:
        if substring in string:
            filtered_strings.append(string)
    return filtered_strings
```
This implementation uses a for loop to iterate through each string in the input list, and checks if the substring is present in the string. If the substring is found, the string is added to a new list called `filtered_strings`. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_strings` list.

---


                              Here's a possible implementation:

def filter\_by\_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
if not strings:
return []

result = [s for s in strings if substring in s]
return result
=============================================================================

Check the implementation against the problem description and write a full set of tests for the function using the `doctest` module.
========================================================================================================================================

Here's a possible test suite:

import doctest

doctest.testmod()
=============================================================================

Make sure to test for both empty input lists and non-empty input lists with and without the substring present.

---


                              Here's an implementation of the `filter_by_substring` function:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    filtered_strings = []
    for s in strings:
        if substring in s:
            filtered_strings.append(s)
    return filtered_strings
```
This function takes in a list of strings and a substring as input and returns a list of all the strings in the input list that contain the substring.

                              Solution:

                              We can iterate through the list and calculate the sum and product of all the integers in the list. We can use a while loop to iterate through the list and keep track of the sum and product. We can return a tuple containing the sum and product once we have iterated through the entire list.

                              Here's the code for the `sum_product` function:

                              def sum\_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
                                  total\_sum = 0
                                  total\_product = 1

                                  for number in numbers:
                                      total\_sum += number
                                      total\_product \*= number

                                  return (total\_sum, total\_product)

                              Test cases:

                              Test an empty list.
                              Test a list containing one integer.

                              Expected output:

                              (0, 1)

                              This is a good start, but it can be improved. For example:
                              - The function should take a type hint for the input and output.
                              - The function should use a try-except block to handle the case when the input list is empty.
                              - The function should return an empty list instead of None when the input list is empty.
                              - The function should use the `rolling_max` function from the `functools` module instead of reinventing the wheel.
                              - The function should use list comprehension to make it more concise and readable.
                              - The function should use the `typing` module to add type hints to the function signature.
                              - The function should include a docstring that explains what the function does and how to use it.

                              Here's an example of what the refactored function could look like:
