---


                    The function should return True if there exists two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold, otherwise it should return False.

                    To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of numbers, and for each element, we check if there is any other element in the list that is closer to it than the threshold. If we find such an element, we return True. Otherwise, we continue checking other elements in the list until we have checked all the elements. If we have checked all the elements and haven't found any pair of elements that are closer to each other than the threshold, we return False.

                    Time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) as we have to check all the pairs of elements in the list.

                    You can use a stack to keep track of open parentheses.
                    
                    Initially, the stack is empty.
                    
                    You iterate through the input string, one character at a time.
                    
                    If the character is an open parenthesis, you push it onto the stack.
                    
                    If the character is a close parenthesis, you pop the stack until you find an open parenthesis that matches the close parenthesis.
                    
                    If the stack becomes empty, it means that we have reached the end of a group of parentheses.
                    
                    You can then add the characters in the group to a list and return that list.

                    The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is a measure of the average distance of each element in a dataset from the mean of the dataset. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between each element and the mean.

                    To calculate the MAD, we first need to calculate the mean of the dataset. We can use the built-in `numpy.mean()` function to do this. Then, for each element in the dataset, we calculate the absolute difference between the element and the mean. Finally, we calculate the average of these absolute differences using the built-in `numpy.mean()` function.

                    The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `paren_string` as input, which contains multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces. For each of the groups, the function will output the deepest level of nesting of the parentheses.

                    The function will return a list of integers, where each integer represents the maximum nesting level of parentheses for each group in the input string. The list will be sorted in ascending order.

                    The function will use a recursive approach to traverse the nested parentheses and count the levels of nesting. It will use a stack to keep track of the current nesting level and the indices of the open and closed parentheses.

                    The function will start by splitting the input string into a list of substrings using the space character as the delimiter. It will then iterate over the list and call the recursive function for each substring.

                    The recursive function will start by checking if the substring is empty or contains only one opening or closing parenthesis. If it is, the function will return the corresponding integer value (0 or 1) as the nesting level.

                    If the substring contains more than one opening or closing parent

                    The problem seems to be finding the deepest level of nesting in a string of nested parentheses.
                    To solve this problem, we can use recursion.

                    The base case would be when the current opening parenthesis does not have a matching closing parenthesis.
                    In this case, we can simply return 0 as the deepest level of nesting.

                    Otherwise, we can keep track of the current level of nesting and recursively call the function with the rest of the string.
                    If the current level of nesting is less than the previous level, then we have found a deeper level of nesting.

                    Finally, we return a list of the deepest level of nesting for each group of nested parentheses in the input string.
                    
                    Here's the implementation of the function:

                    def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
                        levels = 0
                        result = []
                        for i in range(len(paren_string)):
                            if paren_string[i] == '(':
                               

---


                    This problem can be solved by using a list comprehension and the `in` keyword.
                    The list comprehension will iterate over the input list and check if the substring is in the string.
                    If the substring is in the string, it will be added to the output list.

                    Here is the full working function:

                    def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
                        """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring

                            List of strings that contain the given substring

                        Example:

                        return filtered_strings
                    ```

                    The function takes a list of strings and a string to filter. It iterates through the input list of strings and checks if the substring is in the string. If it is, the string is appended to the filtered\_strings list. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of strings.

                    The `filter_by_substring` function filters a list of strings based on the presence of a specified substring. It takes two parameters: a list of strings `strings` and a string `substring`. The function returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the specified substring.

                    Here is the algorithm to solve the problem:

                    1. Iterate through each string in the input list `strings`.
                    2. Check if the current string contains the specified substring `substring`.
                    3. If the current string contains the specified substring, add it to a new list called `filtered_strings`.
                    4. Return the `filtered_strings`.

                    Here is the implementation of the `filter_by_substring` function:

                    Here is an example of a function that calculates the sum and product of a list of numbers.
                    The function takes in a list of integers and returns a tuple containing the sum and product
                    of the numbers in the list.
                    If the list is empty, the function returns (0, 1).

                    The function first calculates the sum of the numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function.
                    Then, it calculates the product of the numbers in the list using a loop.
                    The loop iterates through the list, multiplying each number by the previous one and keeping track
                    of the current product.
                    Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the numbers in the list.

                    Here is the function:

                    The solution to this problem is to use the built-in `math.floor` function to get the 
                    integer part of the number, and then subtract it from the original number to get the decimal 
                    part.

                    Here's the correct implementation of the `truncate_number` function:
                    ```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    integer_part = math.floor(number)
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    return decimal_part
```

                    This function should be tested with the provided examples and any additional test cases you may want to include.

                    The examples provided in the prompt are:
                    ```python
>>> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5
>>> truncate_number(2.7)
0.7
>>> truncate_number(5.2)
0.2
```

                    Additional test cases could include:
                    ```python
>>> truncate_number(0.8)
0.0

                    This problem is asking us to write a function that takes a list of integers as an input, where each integer represents an operation on a bank account. The function should return True if the balance of the bank account ever goes below zero, and False if it never goes below zero.

                    Here's an example of what the input list might look like:

[1, 2, 3]

This list represents the following operations:

1. Deposit 1 unit of currency
2. Deposit 2 units of currency
3. Deposit 3 units of currency

Since we start with a balance of 0, and we never withdraw any currency, the balance will always be positive. Therefore, the function should return False.

Here's another example:

[1, 2, -4, 5]

This list represents the following operations:

1. Deposit 1 unit of currency
2. Deposit 2 units of currency
3. Withdraw 4 units of currency
4. Deposit 5 units of currency

In this case, the balance goes below zero after the third operation,

                    The function takes in a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation as output.
                    The mean absolute deviation is calculated by taking the average of the absolute differences between each element in the list and the mean of the list.
                    The function can be implemented using the following steps:
                    1. Calculate the mean of the input list using the built-in `numpy.mean()` function.
                    2. Calculate the absolute difference between each element in the list and the mean.
                    3. Calculate the average of the absolute differences using the built-in `numpy.mean()` function.
                    4. Return the mean absolute deviation as output.
                    Here's an example of how the function can be implemented:
                    ```python
                    from typing import List
                    from numpy import mean
                    
                    def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
                        # Calculate the mean of the input list
                        mean_value = mean(numbers)
                        
                        # Calculate the absolute difference between each element in the list and the mean
                        absolute_d

---


                    To start, you can create a function named `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of float
                    numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation.

                    First, calculate the mean of the numbers by adding them up and dividing by the length of the
                    list:
                    x_mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

                    Next, calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean:
                    differences = [abs(x - x_mean) for x in numbers]

                    Finally, calculate the mean absolute deviation by taking the average of the differences:
                    return sum(differences) / len(numbers)

                    Test the function with the example provided in the prompt.

                    Your code should be clean and well-structured, following PEP 8 guidelines for style and
                    conventions.

                    Hint: You might find the `statistics` module helpful for calculating the mean and average.

                    from typing import List
                    
                    def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
                        result = []
                        for i in range(0, len(numbers), 2):
                            result.append(numbers[i])
                            result.append(delimeter)
                            if i + 1 < len(numbers):
                                result.append(numbers[i + 1])
                        return result
                    ```
                    
                    This solution works by iterating through the list of numbers in steps of 2, appending every other element to a new list, and inserting the delimiter in between the elements. If there is only one element left in the list, it is appended to the result list as well. Finally, the result list is returned.

                    Please review the solution and suggest any improvements.

                    The solution works as expected, but there is a more concise way to write it using list comprehension.
                    ```python
                    from typing import List

                    print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)) # [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]

                    
                    
                    The code is correct and compilable.

                    Your solution should parse the input string to count the number of opening and closing parentheses,
                    and then return the maximum count of opening parentheses at any level of nesting.
                    To solve this problem, you can use recursion.
                    Start by defining the `parse_nested_parens` function.
                    
                    Example usage:
                    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
                    [2, 3, 1, 3]
                    
                    Hint:
                    You can use a variable to keep track of the maximum number of opening parentheses at each level.
                    Initialize this variable to 0, and update it when you encounter an opening parenthesis at a deeper level.
                    Return this variable when you encounter a closing parenthesis.
                    
                    You can use a list to store all opening parenthesis counts at each level, and return this list when you encounter a closing parenthesis.
                    
                    Test your solution with the example input provided above.

                    This solution should be written in Python.
                    
                    You can assume the input string `paren_string` is well-formed, i.e., it only contains open and closed parentheses.
                    
                    The solution should be able to handle nested parentheses of any depth.
                    
                    You can assume the output list will always have the same number of elements as the number of groups in the input string.

                    Hint: You can use a stack data structure to keep track of the current nesting level and the corresponding index in the input string.

                    This solution uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the strings that contain the given substring.
                    The `if` clause inside the list comprehension is a more concise way of writing a `for` loop with an `if` condition.
                    The `return` statement at the end returns the new list.
                    The function is also correctly annotated with the input and output types.

                    This problem can be solved using a simple nested loop. The outer loop iterates through the list, and the inner loop iterates through the range of numbers from 1 to the current number.

                    This problem can be solved using the `takewhile` function from the `itertools` module.
                    It generates the list of rolling maximum elements by iterating over the input list
                    and keeping only the elements that are less than or equal to the last element in the
                    list. The resulting list is then converted back to a list using the `list` function.
                    
                    The function returns an empty list if the input list is empty.
                    
                    To test the function, provide a sample input list and print the output.
