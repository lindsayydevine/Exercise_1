This function works by maintaining a stack of characters. When it encounters an open parenthesis, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a close parenthesis, it pops off all the characters from the stack until it finds the corresponding open parenthesis, and then adds them to the current group.

Answer the question by write code in python3, and return the code wrapped by ```python and ``` to in a markdown format.

Sure, here is the solution:

```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    max_depth = 0
    max_depths = []
    current_depth = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(paren_string):
        if char == '(':
            current_depth += 1
            max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
        elif char == ')':
            current_depth -= 1
        if i == len(paren_string) - 1 or char == ')':
            max_depths.append(max_depth)
            max_depth = 0
            current_depth = 0
    return max_depths
```

This function iterates through the input string, incrementing the `current_depth` when an open parenthesis is encountered and decrementing it when a close parenthesis is encountered. It keeps track of the maximum depth encountered so far and appends it to the `max_depths` list at the end of each group. The function finally returns the list of maximum depths.

Please note that this function assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain any invalid

Step 1: Define the function with the given name and the required number of arguments.
Step 2: Create a variable to store the list of numbers.
Step 3: Create a variable to store the threshold value.
Step 4: Initialize a variable to store the count of close elements.
Step 5: Iterate over the list of numbers.
Step 6: Check if the difference between the current number and the next number is less than the threshold.
Step 7: If the difference is less than the threshold, increment the count of close elements.
Step 8: Return the count of close elements.
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) < threshold:

2. For each number, find the closest number in the list
3. Check if the closest number is within the threshold
4. If the closest number is within the threshold, return True
5. If the closest number is not within the threshold, return False

Steps:

1. Split the input string into a list of substrings using the ')' character as the delimiter.
2. Iterate through the list, starting at the first item and checking if it is an open parenthesis.
3. If the current item is an open parenthesis, create a new list and add the current item to it.
4. Continue iterating through the list, adding any open parenthesis to the current list until a close parenthesis is encountered.
5. Once a close parenthesis is encountered, add the current list to the final list and reset the current list to an empty list.
6. Return the final list of separated groups.

```

    current_list = []
    for substring in substrings:
        # Step 3: Check if the current item is an open parenthesis

---



Steps:

1. Initialize an empty list called result.
2. Initialize a variable called start_index with 0.
3. Loop through the input string, starting from the second index.
4. In each iteration, check if the current character is a left parenthesis ().
5. If it is, increment the start\_index.
6. If it is not, check if the current character is a right parenthesis ).
7. If it is, decrement the start\_index.
8. If it is not, add the substring from start\_index to the current index to the result list.
9. Repeat steps 3-8 until the end of the input string is reached.
10. Return the result list.

Here's the code solution:
```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    start_index = 0
    for i in range(1, len(paren_string)):

---



Steps to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the separated groups.
2. Loop through the input string and keep track of the opening and closing parentheses using two variables, open\_paren and close\_paren.
3. Check if the open\_paren is equal to the close\_paren. If yes, then it means that the current group is closed and we can append the current group to the list of separated groups.
4. If the open\_paren is not equal to the close\_paren, it means that the current group is not closed yet. In this case, we need to check if the current group is the first group or not. If it is the first group, then we can append the current group to the list of separated groups.
5. If the current group is not the first group, then we need to check if the current group is the last group or not. If it is the last group, then we can append the current group to the list of separated groups.
6. If the current group is not the last group, then we need to append the current group to a sublist of the current group's parent list.

Steps:

1. Initialize a variable balance to store the current balance of the bank account. Set it to 0.
2. Initialize a variable index to store the current index in the list of operations. Set it to 0.
3. Loop through the list of operations using a while loop.
4. Inside the while loop, perform the following steps:
a. Add the value of the current operation to the current balance.
b. Increment the index by 1.
5. After the while loop, check if the final balance is below 0. If it is, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here's the generated code solution:

def below\_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
balance = 0
index = 0
```python
while index < len(operations):
    balance += operations[index]

b. If it's a deposit, add the value to the balance.
4. After all operations have been processed, check if the balance is below zero.
5. Return True if the balance is below zero, otherwise return False.

Here's the code solution:

def below\_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
balance = 0
for operation in operations:
if operation > 0:
balance += operation
else:
balance -= operation
return balance < 0

a. If it's a deposit operation, add the amount to the current balance.
b. If it's a withdrawal operation, subtract the amount from the current balance.
5. After the iterations, check if the current balance is below zero. If yes, set the below\_zero variable to True.
6. Return the value of the below\_zero variable.

from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    below_zero = False

Steps:
1. Check if the input list is empty or not
2. If the list is empty, return an empty list
3. Initialize two pointers, one to keep track of the current element and one to keep track of the next delimiter to be inserted
4. Loop through the input list

6. Return the `result` list.

Code:
```
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if i % 2 == 0:

    return (sum, product)  # return the sum and product as a tuple
```

---



Steps:

1. Create an empty list to store the results (sum and product).
2. Iterate through the input list, and for each integer:
a. Append the integer to the sum list.
b. Append the product of all integers in the sum list (including the current integer) to the product list.
3. Return the sum list as the first element of the tuple and the product list as the second element of the tuple.

Solution:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    results = []  # create an empty list to store the results
    
    for number in numbers:
        results.append(number)  # append the number to the sum list
        product = 1
        
        for result in results:
            product *= result  # multiply the product by each result
        
        results.append(product)  # append the product to the results list
    
    return tuple(results)  # return the sum list as the first element of the tuple and the product list as the second element of the

Steps to solve the problem:
1. Initialize an empty list called result to store the rolling maximum values.
2. Iterate through the given list of numbers.
3. For each iteration, keep track of the maximum value found so far in a variable called max\_value.
4. If the current number is greater than the max\_value, update max\_value to the current number.
5. Append the max\_value to the result list.
6. Return the result list.

Here is the code solution:
def rolling\_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
result = []
for number in numbers:
max\_value = number
for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
if numbers[i] > max\_value:
max\_value = numbers[i]
result.append(max\_value)
return result

Example usage:
rolling\_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]

---



Step 1: Define the function rolling\_max with a parameter list of numbers.
Step 2: Create an empty list called rolling\_max\_list.
Step 3: Initialize a variable called current\_max and set it to the first element in the list of numbers.
Step 4: Initialize a variable called current\_index and set it to the first index in the list of numbers.
Step 5: Iterate through the list of numbers.
Step 6: If the current element is greater than the current max, update the current\_max variable to the current element.
Step 7: Update the rolling\_max\_list by appending the current\_max variable.
Step 8: If the current index is the last index in the list of numbers, return the rolling\_max\_list.
Step 9: If the current index is not the last index in the list of numbers, increment the current\_index by 1 and go back to step 5.

Solution:

def rolling\_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
rolling\_max\_list = []
current\_max = numbers[0]
current\_index = 0

---



 Steps:

1. Create an empty list to store the rolling maximum elements.
2. Iterate over the given list of numbers.
3. For each iteration, calculate the maximum element found until the current moment in the sequence.
4. Append this element to the list of rolling maximum elements.
5. Return the list of rolling maximum elements.

```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Create an empty list to store the rolling maximum elements.
    rolling_max_elements = []

    # Iterate over the given list of numbers.
    for number in numbers:
        # For each iteration, calculate the maximum element found until the current moment in the sequence.
        max_element = max(numbers[:number])

        # Append this element to the list of rolling maximum elements.
        rolling_max_elements.append(max_element)

    # Return the list of rolling maximum elements.
    return rolling_max_elements

Example:
Input: '( ) (( )) (( )( ))'
Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']

Constraints:
1 <= len(paren_string) <= 10^5
1 <= len(each group) <= 10^5
Each group contains only '(' and ')' characters.
Hints:
- You can use a stack to keep track of the current group.
- You can use a variable to keep track of the current group opening character (either '(' or '{' depending on the current character).
- You can use a variable to keep track of the current group closing character (either ')' or '}').
- You can use a loop to iterate through the string.
- You can use the stack.pop() method to remove the current group from the stack.
- You can use the stack.append() method to add a new group to the stack.
- You can use the index of the current character in the string to determine whether to append or prepend the current character to the current group.

My solution:
```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        else:
            balance -= operation
    return balance < 0
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of operations as input and initializes the balance to 0. It then iterates through the list and adds the value of each positive operation to the balance and subtracts the value of each negative operation from the balance. Finally, it returns True if the balance is less than 0, indicating that the account has gone below zero at some point, and False otherwise.

---



This is a function that takes a list of integers representing operations on a bank account. These operations can be either deposits or withdrawals. The function returns True if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and False otherwise.

Here's an example of how the function might be used:
below\_zero([1, 2, 3])  # returns False
below\_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])  # returns True

Here's some sample code to get started:
```
def below_zero(operations):
    account_balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            account_balance += operation
        else:
            account_balance -= operation
        if account_balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code looks good at first glance, but there's a potential issue with it. Specifically, if there are more withdrawals than deposits, the account balance will never become positive again, so the function will return False even if there are additional deposits after the first withdrawal. To fix this, we need

---



Answer: Here's the first pass of code:
```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        else:
            balance -= operation
    return balance < 0
```
Let's self-evaluate this code:

* The function takes a list of integers `operations` as input and returns a boolean value.
* The variable `balance` is initialized to 0.
* The function iterates through each `operation` in `operations`.
* If `operation` is positive, it is added to the `balance`.
* If `operation` is negative, it is subtracted from the `balance`.
* Finally, the function returns `True` if the `balance` is less than 0, otherwise it returns `False`.

The code looks correct and should work for the given prompt. Here's the function below:
```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations
